# python_websockets_battery_server
Taken from my Command-Er Mini repo. Battery Server using WebSockets.

Designed with this hardware in mind: 
  * [Raspberry Pi Zero WH Package F, with UPS Module and 1.3inch LCD](https://www.waveshare.com/raspberry-pi-zero-wh-package-f.htm) 
  * [Command-Er Mini](https://github.com/nicksen782/Command-Er_mini)

A WebSockets client can connect to this server and request updates to the battery status.
